## Creating connectino schema for the assistant

We are using `@rjsf/core` to render the forms, so in order to add you driver to the connection assistant,
edit `connection.schema.json` and `ui.schema.json`.

See https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for more instructions.

## Publish the driver
